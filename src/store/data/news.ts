      'Cars will feature slimmer bodywork and simplified surfaces, reducing the strength and complexity of the wake generated.',
      'A revised floor concept plays a central role, designed to be less sensitive to disturbed airflow.',
      'Wheel wake control devices help manage the turbulent air created by rotating tyres, one of the biggest challenges for close racing.',
